AR-Connect
======

AR-Connect is an iOS application for helping users find each other using augmented reality. Using Firebase, RxSwift, and ARKit, AR Connect provides a simple and easy way to set a meetup location with a friend and find their way there.

Motivation
======

In a crowded city, everyone knows the frustration of coming out of the subway and not knowing which way is North or which street they need to walk down. Often we'll choose our best guess, watch our location indicator move down the wrong street, then turn around and figure it out.

After, once you get to where you need to go, you and whoever you're meeting up with are struggling to figure out the details regarding meeting up.

*What side of the street are we meeting on?*
*How close are they?*
*Which corner are they standing on?*

**This is the problem I am addressing with AR Connect**

By allowing users to agree and confirm a meetup location, receive their own walking directions and visual path to their meetup spot, and see their path in augmented reality using ARKit, AR Connect provides a simple and intuitive tool for making connecting with friends that much easier.

Users can:
* Request to connect with a user at a chosen meetup location
* Use their camera and AR to see a graphical representation of the shortest path to their meetup spot
* See a visual indicator of their friend's location
